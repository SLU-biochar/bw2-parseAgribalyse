The data refers to one big operation in Europe (Campine Ltd, Belgium, as in Campine NV, 2006) that operates with representative technology. Thus, the reliability and correctness of the data set is limited and may not be applicable to life cycle assessment studies of products where the production of secondary lead becomes important.

This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

The soybeans which are not up to specifications are eliminated. Soybeans are not dehulled. They are first soaked and remain there for a certain period of time (approximately 24 hours). The soaking water is continuously removed as fresh water enters the vessels. The soybeans are then grounded under airless condition. The resulting slurry is then centrifuged to obtain a soy base at 5% protein, separated from a moist solid co-product, the okara, which is valorized as animal feed. A coagulant is then added to the soy base for protein coagulation and, although there is a number of useable coagulant, calcium sulfate is typically used. This step results in whey and curds. The curd is pressed to remove the whey, submitted to heat for pasteurization (around 80°C), cooled and then cut into blocks. Note that different methods exist where the soy base is first heated before coagulation and pressing or where heat treatment is applied on packaged tofu blocks. In any case, a refrigerated storage is necessary afterwards. A more advanced sterilization process using UHT and aseptic packaging allows room temperature storage but is not common yet in Canada.

It is primarily used for the de-icing of roads. For this application, calcium chloride is used in the form of flakes with at least 77 wt% calcium chloride. There are no special requirements on the purity of the product for this application. Other areas of application of calcium chloride include road stabilisation and dust control, industrial processing, oil and gas well fluids, and concrete production.\\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

EMPA Dübendorf, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, Dübendorf, CH.\\nSoda is primarily used in the glass industry as raw material for the decomposition of sand. Another important use of soda is in the chemical industry for the production of chemicals. In the detergent and soap industry, soda ash is used for the manufacture of detergents and for the saponification of grease. Also the paper and cellulose industry uses soda for the digestion, the neutralization, the cleaning and the leaching as well as for the recycling of wastepaper. \\nThis dataset is based on literature data, mainly from a German report on the best available techniques (BAT) for soda production. The production of sodium bicarbonate has been introduced in a second step to the dataset. The solvay process can produce a number or by-products, among which sodium bicarbonate. The main production route of sodium bicarbonate is the Solvay process, followed by the other commercially available process, Trona ore mining. The dataset has been adjusted accordingly, knowing that 2 moles of sodium bicarbonate are needed to produce 1 mol of soda, threfore the dataset has been modified based on the Solvay process step: 2NaHCO3 --(heat)--> Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 (CO2 is recirculated in the process).\\nReferences:\\n\\nProduction volume: 1543800711.06864 kg\\nIncluded activities start: The activity starts when the raw materials enter the process.\\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the production of soda and calcium chloride. The dataset includes the consumption of raw materials, auxiliaries, energy, infrastructure and land use. The system also includes the generation of wastes and emissions into air and water. The production of light soda is considered; the process to obtain heavy soda from light soda is not included.\\nEnergy values: \\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\\nTechnology level: 3\\nTechnology: Soda ash is manufactured in two grades: ”light ash“ and ”heavy ash“, the difference being the much greater volume occupied by a given mass of light ash. Heavy ash, when transported in bulk, has a pouring density equal to or slightly above that of water, whereas the pouring density of light ash is only half of this value. Heavy ash is clearly the preferred form for economic transportation over long distances. For general chemicals production, light ash is widely used because of its traditionally lower price, its higher rate of dissolution and reaction, and its freedom from calcium ions, which are unacceptable in certain processes, as for example in soap manufacture.---comment merge---The manufacture of soda with the Solvay technique is carried out by the conversion of sodium chloride (salt) and calcium carbonate (limestone) according to the following overall equation:---comment merge---2NaCl + CaCO3 ?

This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of rice grains, at standard water content required for storage (13.1%). The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 6.6 t/ha. The data are representative for a double rice cropping system in Southern China (Hunan province), representing the largest rice-producing province of China. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 72-23-26 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.55 kg a.i./ha.\\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of rice produced in China amounts to 28% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing rice produced in China for the export market.\\n\\nProduction volume: 200636395500 kg\\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of rice grains and subsequent burning of crop residues. A winter fallow is following the harvest of late rice, where no irrigation is applied. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: rotary tillage, the application of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation and harvesting, and on-farm transport. Rice seedlings are transplanted manually by throwing the seedlings in the standing water. Paddy rice is grown under flooded conditions (~40-50 mm water depth) for the entire growing season except for the aeration stage and one week prior to harvest (i.e. ~80 days under flooded conditions per crop cycle). Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. In the considered region of China, rice is produced in a double rice cropping system (two crop cycles). Therefore, an average of the two crop cycles was used for the considered inputs. The inputs of seeds, irrigation water, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include a) grain drying, as no information was available and b) the production of rice seedlings (seeds are used as input). \\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated. \\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy values: \\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for China\\nTechnology level: 3\\nTechnology: Conventional production\\nStart date: 01/01/2009\\nEnd date: 31/12/2018\\nIs data valid for entire period: True\\nTime period: \\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\\n\\nVersion: 3.0.2.0\\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\\nLast edited: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\\nSource: 32041_a071fafe-6d02-4c3a-a028-ef4bd836c828_e50fbfef-68be-4c56-9763-88007f342ad5.spold\\nUUID: a071fafe-6d02-4c3a-a028-ef4bd836c828\\nBoundary with nature: Unspecified\\nRecord: data entry by: Patrik Mouron lca@agroscope.admin.ch Reckenholzstrasse 1919, 8046 Zürich, Switzerland is active author:\\nGenerator: generated by: Eliane Riedener eliane.riedener@agroscope.admin.ch\\n\", 'ID': 45845, 'REF_ID': '24c7741f-2ff3-3145-9e36-7ad2cb1e7f02', 'VERSION': 0, 'LAST_CHANGE': 0, 'PROCESS_TYPE': 'UNIT_PROCESS', 'DEFAULT_ALLOCATION_METHOD': 'PHYSICAL', 'INFRASTRUCTURE_PROCESS': 0, 'F_LOCATION': 2882.0},\n",

It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\\n\\nProduction volume: 0.242058495271711 kg\\nIncluded activities start: From reception of the potato at the factory gate.\\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the production of starch from potato.

Data from one plant representing 4% of the total amount of anchovy processed into Prime fishmeal (155 535 t/y out of 5.2 million t/y * 84%, in 2008-2010). The technology is common in the world for Prime fishmeal production.\\n\\nAfter arrival of the fishing vessel at the floating terminal, the fish is pumped out of the vessel’s hold and conveyed to the plant mixed with seawater in a proportion close to 1 m3 per t of fish. There the fish is separated from the mix of water, fish residues and blood (bloodwater) through a screw drainer. The drained bloodwater is processed in a rotating screen in order to remove the solid residues (flesh, scale, etc.) that are then conveyed to the “solid line” (described below), and the remaining water is processed first in an oil and solids separator and then in a flotation tank where oil is recuperated thanks to its positive buoyancy. The oil is conveyed to the “liquid line” (described below) whereas the remaining water is discharged at sea through a long underwater pipe (e.g. one-km long). In modern plants, the flotation process is accelerated by the release of fine air bubbles at the bottom of the flotation tank. The remaining bulk of the fish is then conveyed by a wire mesh conveyor belt to an automated weighting hopper and then released into large storage pits. From there fish is conveyed to a cooker using a conveyor, whereas additional bloodwater is processed into a specific trommel. There, a continuous cooking occurs by means of an internal rotary screw conveyor, at a temperature of 95 to 100°C in order to coagulate the proteins. The cooking process is indirect, thanks to steam-heated jacket surrounding the conveyor, but still generates odorous fumes. From the cooker the product is conveyed to strainer (or first to a pre-strainer and then to double helicoid press) that allows draining a mix of oil, protein (dissolved and suspended) and water from the solid mass, thanks to the previous cooking step. From the straining process starts the major separation between the liquid line (oily water or “press liquor\"\") and the solid line (presscake), but with further bridging connections. \\nThe processes in the liquid line consists in a further separation between oil, water and protein coming from different paths. The press liquor, along with the bloodwater, is first transferred by pipe to an oil and liquid separator (or decanter) which is a horizontal centrifuge. After two to three separation phases, the oil and liquid separator returns the remaining solid (sludge) to the solid line whereas the liquid goes to a vertical disk centrifuge.

The drained bloodwater is processed in a rotating screen in order to remove the solid residues (flesh, scale, etc.) that are then conveyed to the “solid line” (described below), and the remaining water is processed first in an oil and solids separator and then in a flotation tank where oil is recuperated thanks to its positive buoyancy. The oil is conveyed to the “liquid line” (described below) whereas the remaining water is discharged at sea through a long underwater pipe (e.g. one-km long). In modern plants, the flotation process is accelerated by the release of fine air bubbles at the bottom of the flotation tank. The remaining bulk of the fish is then conveyed by a wire mesh conveyor belt to an automated weighting hopper and then released into large storage pits. From there fish is conveyed to a cooker using a conveyor, whereas additional bloodwater is processed into a specific trommel. There, a continuous cooking occurs by means of an internal rotary screw conveyor, at a temperature of 95 to 100°C in order to coagulate the proteins. The cooking process is indirect, thanks to steam-heated jacket surrounding the conveyor, but still generates odorous fumes. From the cooker the product is conveyed to strainer (or first to a pre-strainer and then to double helicoid press) that allows draining a mix of oil, protein (dissolved and suspended) and water from the solid mass, thanks to the previous cooking step. From the straining process starts the major separation between the liquid line (oily water or “press liquor\"\") and the solid line (presscake), but with further bridging connections. \\nThe processes in the liquid line consists in a further separation between oil, water and protein coming from different paths.

The slurry process uses phosphoric acid with a concentration of 42% P2O5 and has an energy requirement 20% lower than in the two-step process. This dataset represents triple superphosphate production with the slurry process.\\n\\nPrimary data were collected on fertilizer production for the year 2011.

Sulfuric acid (formula H2SO4) is a colorless to yellow, oily, dense liquid with a sharp, acrid odor. \\nSulfuric acid is used in nearly all industrial sectors and is a vital commodity in any national economy. Most of its uses are actually indirect, in that the sulfuric acid is used as a reagent rather than an ingredient. The largest single sulfuric acid consumer by far is the fertilizer industry. There, sulfuric acid is used with phosphate rock in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers and smaller amounts are also used in the production of ammonium and potassium sulfate. Substantial quantities are used as an acidic dehydrating agent in organical chemical and petrochemical processes, as well as in oil refining. In the metal processing industry, sulfuric acid is used for pickling and descaling steel; for the extraction of copper, uranium and vanadium from ores; and in non-ferrous metal purification and plating. In the inorganic chemical industry, it is used most notably in the production of titanium dioxide. \\nCertain wood pulping processes for paper also require sulfuric acid, as do some textile and fiber processes (such as rayon and cellulose manufacture) and leather tanning. Other end uses for sulfuric acid include effluent/water treatment, plasticisers, dyestuffs, explosives, silicate for toothpaste, adhesives, rubbers, edible oils, lubricants and the manufacture of food acids such as citric acid and lactic acid. Probably the largest use of sulfuric acid in which this chemical becomes incorporated into the final product is in organic sulphonation processes, particularly for the production of detergents. Many pharmaceuticals are also made by sulphonation processes.\\n\\nReference flow: 1 kg of sulfuric acid (as kg H2SO4), at the plant exit gate\\n\\nTechnology: There are several sources of sulfur in order to produce sulphuric acid: sulfur originating from crude oil or natural gas industry, sulfur originating from the metal industry and sulphur from pyrite mining. Besides, sulfuric acid can be produced by recycling, i.e. reusing, existing sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is produced from sulfur dioxide, its conversion into sulfur trioxide and flowingly, the adsorption of sulfur trioxide by water, resulting in sulfuric acid. Reactions are strongly exothermic, however depending on the production process of the sulfur dioxide. The production of sulfur dioxide from metal sulphate roasting and the regeneration of sulfuric acid is not exothermic. The production of sulphur dioxide is conducted on different ways, depending on the sulphuric acid production route: combustion of sulphur, combustion of sulfur containing gases, metal sulfide roasting, roasting of pyrite and sulfuric acid regeneration. For the use of sulfuric acid as an auxiliary product in the fertiliser production process it is assumed, that the sulfur enters the system free of burden. This assumption is confirmed by the oil and gas industry. The reason is explained below: Most crude oil and gas deposits found around the globe contain a varying proportion of sulfurous compounds. At a refinery, the sulfur is stripped from the feedstock to ensure that the fuel products produced from the refining operations can meet government requirements for allowable sulfur content (typically <10 ppm for road transport fuels in many jurisdictions). Thus, it can be said that: Refineries would not produce elemental sulfur if they did not have to. The same amount of sulphur would be produced even if no application existed for it. All the refinery emissions and the cost of desulphurisation are currently allocated to the hydrocarbon products. Sulfur in crude gas streams is generally in the form of hydrogen sulfide and is removed at the wellhead before transport. Environmental regulations prevent its incineration and so it is extracted as elemental sulfur.\\n\\nCo-products: steam is produced as co-product. Economic allocation is applied (78.36% to sulfuric acid)\\n\\nPrimary data were collected on fertilizer production for the year 2011. These data were based on annual average data for the year 2011. \\n\\nThe main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2016) and Althaus et al (2007).

The average annual clear-cutting of primary forest associated with the cultivation of oil palms is calculated as land tenure, arable land (the replacement of plantations is considered without any effect).  The loss/gain in carbon from mineral soils/organic soils/biomass growth is calculated as \"\"carbon, organic, from soil or biomass stock\"\" and released as \"\"carbon dioxide, from soil or biomass stock\"\".

Grain drying is not needed in Australia and straw is left on the field. Fertiliser is applied simultanously with sowing except the application of lime, which occurs every 10 years. Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.\\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of wheat grains, at standard water content required for storage (15%). The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year from 2009 - 2012, which is 1.8 t/ha from a non-irrigated production. The data are representative for long fallow dryland wheat in the Central Zone (East) of New South Wales. This region is the second largest wheat production area in Australia (30% of total production). In the last decade (from 2001/02 to 2010/11) average yield amounted to 1.6 t/ha.year in this region. This is due to the fact, that this average includes also low rainfall farms and the high variability in annual wheat production of 45%.

The functional unit is 50300kg of sugarcane (1ha).\\nIncluded processes: The inventory takes into account the chemical and organic fertilization, emissions from pesticides, machinery, diesel, emissions from fertilizers.\\nInformations are provided by AgriFootPrint (processus : \"\" Sugar cane, at farm/PK Economic\"\").\\nTechnology: see documentation from AgriFootPrint.\\nTime period: 2005-2012\\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nThis process describes the average yearly production of sugar cane on a hectare on a typical farm in Pakistan.\\nThe system boundaries of this process are from farm gate to farm gate. Considered activities include fertilizer use, diesel use for field management practices. The elementary flows include field emissions to the air and water, direct land use change, water use and emissions due to pesticide use. Multiple cropping, capital goods, pesticide production, seed production are not included.\\nTotal NPK (counted as kg N, kg P2O5, kg K2O equivalents) application per ha from synthetic fertilizers  = 125 - 130 - 0\\nThe total NPK (counted as kg N, kg P2O5, kg K2O equivalents) per Ha from animal manure is = 29 - 18.79 - 23.69\\nCrop yields were derived from 2005-2009 FAO statistics (FAOStat, FAO, 2013), or regional data sources if they provided more accurate data or if yield data is not reported by FAO statistics (for example (USDA, 2009)). This yield is reduced by 5% to account for losses due to moisture loss, storage and other factors. Fertilizer application rates (in terms of N, P and K requirements) were generally derived from (Palli�re, 2011). Energy use was calculated based on data obtained from the farm simulation tool MEBOT (Schreuder, Dijk, Asperen, Boer, & Schoot, 2008). Specific fertilizer amounts are calculated based on crop specific nutrient requirements and country specific fertilizer mix derived from International Fertilizer Association (IFA) statistics (IFA, 2012). Animal manure is applied for soil maintenance based on the methodology described in appendix 4 of Vellinga et al. (2013). Heavy metals emissions due to manure and artificial fertilizer application have been calculated based on an adapted methodology from Nemecek & Schnetzer (2012). It is taking into account the heavy metal balance as a function of deposition, use of fertilizer and crop uptake using literature concerning heavy metal contents in manure (Romkens & Rietra, 2008) and in fertilizers (Mels, Bisschops, & Swart, 2008). Water use has been based on the \\'blue water\\' footprint (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2010). Land use change has been calculated using \"\"Direct Land Use Change Assessment Tool (Version 2014.1 - 21 January 2014)\"\" (Blonk Consultants, 2014). Pesticide application rates were taken from a large volume of literature sources.
